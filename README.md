## Project1
<p> 1. Definition of State variable </p>
<p> 2. Created some events</p>
<p> 3. Wrote logical definitions between variables</p>
<p> 4. How the events run through the event graph </p>
<p> 5. Modified the parameters to analyze the results</p>

## Final Project
<p> 1. Definition of the phsical and mac layer's parametwrs</p>
<p> 2. Wrote physical/mac/network layer</p>
<p> 3. Wrote CSMA Algo with DIFS/SIFS/PIFS definitions</p>
<p> 4. Wrote backoff Algo and RTS/CTS mechanisms</p>
<p> 5. Separated sender and reciever parts</p>
<p> 6. Measured final performance and established chart to analysis</p>
